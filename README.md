# Supernice

Set the I/O-scheduling class, priority and niceness to relaxed values when launching a process.

This was originally a fork of `ionice` from `util-linux`.

Running `supernice` is the equivalent of running both `ionice -c3` and `nice -n20`.

This can be useful to prevent processes from hogging the CPU and/or the I/O.

If you have ever watched the mouse cursor freeze when compiling a large project, this utility is for you.

* Linux
